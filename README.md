# TicTacToe AI Practice Project

This project is a web-based Tic-Tac-Toe game created as a way to practice using AI tools for software development. The process began by writing a `requirements.md` file, then using large language models (LLMs) to generate a detailed spec sheet, and finally building the playable game using JavaScript, HTML, and CSS.

## Purpose
- Practice guiding AI (LLMs) to assist in project creation
- Review and reinforce knowledge of JavaScript, HTML, and CSS
- Explore iterative development with AI, starting from basic requirements and specs
- Develop skills in collaborating with AI as a tool, rather than relying on it to fully code a project

## Future Plans
I plan to continue iterating on this project, introducing more complex technologies and features, while using LLMs to assist and accelerate development. The goal is to become more effective at directing AI to create, refine, and extend software projects.

## How to Play
- Run the web page locally however you may please
- Open the project in a web browser
- Click "Start Game" to begin
- Two players take turns clicking cells to place their marks
- The game announces the winner or a tie, and can be restarted

This project is part of my ongoing journey to master AI-assisted software creation and improve my ability to guide AI as a creative tool.
